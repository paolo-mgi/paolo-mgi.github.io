Kraichnan's model of passive advection is to-date the only PDE model of turbulence where intermittency and multiscaling can be proven in a mathematically controlled fashion. The result was first independently derived in the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.3834">diffusion </a>, <a href="http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.52.4924"> large dimension </a>, and <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6202126w/f39.item.r=Shraiman%20Siggia">laminar</a> limits and <a href="http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.5532">numerically</a> also by us <a href="/publications#10.1103/PhysRevE.63.015302" >here</a>.

The connection between multiscaling and intermittency is due to the existence of <a href="http://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023212600779">statistical conservation laws</a>, martingales, associated to shapes formed by Lagrangian particles in their many body translational invariant configuration space.
<br/>
In retrospective, the result of <a href="/publications#10.1007/s10955-006-9205-9">Kupiainen et al. </a> I am most pleased with, is having clarified the relation between <a href="http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.58.1823"> quantum field theory methods</a> and scaling predictions based on many body Hopf's equations.
<br/>
Later <a href="/publications#10.1103/PhysRevE.80.025301">here</a> and <a href="/publications#10.1016/j.physd.2011.05.023">here 
 </a>, I used these methods to exhibit how a geometric signature is encoded in the scaling exponent as their perturative expressions admits a classification in terms of Gel'fand-Zeitlin patterns of \(\mathrm{SL}(N\,,\mathbb{R})\) in agreement to an early <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.77.2463">general conjecture</a>.
