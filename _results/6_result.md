In a series of papers, culminating with a publication in the prestigious <a href="http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6633/ae075f">Reports on Progress on Physics </a> together with <a href="https://fizyka.umk.pl/~darch/">Dariusz Chruściński</a>,  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhPkf50AAAAJ&hl=de">Frederik vom Ende</a> and <a href="https://qsys.se.shibaura-it.ac.jp/kimura/index_en.html">Gen Kimura</a> we proved that the fastest relaxation rate of a map solution of a quantum master equation obeys a non-trivial upper bound that only depends on the positivity class of the semi-group whereof the map is an element.

One reason that makes the bound particularly interesting because has no classical counterpart. as such it is a distinctive trait of open quantum system dynamics. The bound was conjectured by Kimura in the early 00's of this century and remained unproven for about two decades.</br>
