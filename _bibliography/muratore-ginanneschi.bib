  abstract  = {The superdiffusion behavior, i.e. <x2(t)>∼t2ν, with ν>1/2, in general is not completely characherized by a unique exponent. We study some systems exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion, i.e. <|x(t)|q>∼tqν(q) where ν(2)>1/2 and qν(q) is not a linear function of q. This feature is different from the weak superdiffusion regime, i.e. ν(q)=const>1/2, as in random shear flows. The strong anomalous diffusion can be generated by nontrivial chaotic dynamics, e.g. Lagrangian motion in 2d time-dependent incompressible velocity fields, 2d symplectic maps and 1d intermittent maps. Typically the function qν(q) is piecewise linear. This corresponds to two mechanisms: a weak anomalous diffusion for the typical events and a ballistic transport for the rare excursions. In order to have strong anomalous diffusion one needs a violation of the hypothesis of the central limit theorem, this happens only in a very narrow region of the control parameters space.},

The scope of this review is to present in a self-contained way recent developments in functional determinant theory allowing to revisit the Gutzwiller trace formula in the spirit of field theory. The field theoretic setup permits to work explicitly at every step of the derivation of the trace formula with invariant quantities of classical periodic orbits. R. Forman's theory of functional determinants of linear, non singular elliptic operators yields the expression of quantum quadratic fluctuations around classical periodic orbits directly in terms of the monodromy matrix of the periodic orbits. The phase factor associated to quadratic fluctuations, the Maslov phase, is shown to be specified by the Morse index for closed extremals, also known as Conley and Zehnder index.},

The optimization problem is solved by a Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi equation, which by the verification theorem has well-behaved solutions if certain conditions on a potential are satisfied. In the case at hand, these conditions simply imply arbitrage-free ("Black-Scholes") pricing of the derivative. While pricing is hence not changed by friction allow a portfolio to fluctuate around a delta hedge. In the limit of weak friction, we determine the optimal control to essentially be of two parts: a strong control, which tries to bring the stock-and-derivative portfolio towards a Black-Scholes delta hedge; and a weak control, which moves the portfolio by adding or subtracting a Black-Scholes hedge. For simplicity we assume growth-optimal investment criteria and quadratic friction.},

In this method the sharp fluid interface is replaced by a thin, yet finite, transition layer where the interfacial forces vary smoothly. This is achieved by introducing an order parameter (the phase field) whose variation is continuous across the interfacial layers and is uniform in the bulk region. The phase field model obeys a Cahn--Hilliard equation and is two-way coupled to the standard Navier--Stokes equations. Starting from this system of equations we have first performed a linear analysis from which we have analytically rederived the known gravity-capillary dispersion relation in the limit of vanishing mixing energy density and capillary width. We have performed numerical simulations and identified a region of parameters in which the known properties of the linear phase (both stable and unstable) are reproduced in a very accurate way. This has been done both in the case of negligible viscosity and in the case of nonzero viscosity. In the latter situation only upper and lower bounds for the perturbation growth-rate are known. Finally, we have also investigated the weakly-nonlinear stage of the perturbation evolution and identified a regime characterized by a constant terminal velocity of bubbles/spikes. The measured value of the terminal velocity is in perfect agreement with available theoretical prediction. The phase-field approach thus appears to be a valuable tecnhique for the dynamical description of the stages where hydrodynamic turbulence and wave-turbulence enter into play.},

  abstract      = {We inquire the statistical properties of the pair formed by the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible velocity field and the advection-diffusion equation for a scalar field transported in the same flow in two dimensions (2d). The system is in a regime of fully developed turbulence stirred by forcing fields with Gaussian statistics, white-noise in time and self-similar in space. In this setting and if the stirring is concentrated at small spatial scales as if due to thermal fluctuations, it is possible to carry out a first-principle ultra-violet renormalization group analysis of the scaling behavior of the model. Kraichnan's phenomenological theory of two dimensional turbulence upholds the existence of an inertial range characterized by inverse energy transfer at scales larger than the stirring one. For our model Kraichnan's theory, however, implies scaling predictions radically discordant from the renormalization group results. We perform accurate numerical experiments to assess the actual statistical properties of 2d-turbulence with power-law stirring. Our results clearly indicate that an adapted version of Kraichnan's theory is consistent with the observed phenomenology. We also provide some theoretical scenarios to account for the discrepancy between renormalization group analysis and the observed phenomenology.},

We show that optimization problems in small system thermodynamics are solved by (deterministic) optimal transport, for which very efficient numerical methods have been developed, and of which there are applications in Cosmology, fluid mechanics, logistics, and many other fields. We show, in particular, that minimizing expected heat released or work done during a non-equilibrium transition in finite time is solved by Burgers equation of Cosmology and mass transport by the Burgers velocity field.

  abstract      = {The large-scale/long-time transport of inertial particles of arbitrary mass density under gravity is investigated by means of a formal multiple-scale perturbative expansion in the scale-separation parametre between the carrier flow and the particle concentration field. The resulting large-scale equation for the particle concentration is determined, and is found to be diffusive with a positive-definite eddy diffusivity. The calculation of the latter tensor is reduced to the resolution of an auxiliary differential problem, consisting of a coupled set of two differential equations in a (6+1)-dimensional coordinate system (3 space coordinates plus 3 velocity coordinates plus time). Although expensive, numerical methods can be exploited to obtain the eddy diffusivity, for any desirable non-perturbative limit (e.g. arbitrary Stokes and Froude numbers). The aforementioned large-scale equation is then specialized to deal with two different relevant perturbative limits: i) vanishing of both Stokes time and sedimenting particle velocity; ii) vanishing Stokes time and finite sedimenting particle velocity. Both asymptotics lead to a greatly simplified auxiliary differential problem, now involving only space coordinates and thus easy to be tackled by standard numerical techniques. Explicit, exact expressions for the eddy diffusivities have been calculated, for both asymptotics, for the class of parallel flows, both static and time-dependent. This allows us to investigate analytically the role of gravity and inertia on the diffusion process by varying relevant features of the carrier flow, as e.g. the form of its temporal correlation function. Our results exclude a universal role played by gravity and inertia on the diffusive behaviour: regimes of both enhanced and reduced diffusion may exist, depending on the detailed structure of the carrier flow.},

In any spatial dimension d, we observe the convergence of the resulting renormalization group flow to a unique fixed point which yields a kinetic energy spectrum scaling in agreement with canonical dimension analysis. Kolmogorov's -5/3 law is, thus, recovered for ε=2 as also predicted by perturbative renormalization. At variance with the perturbative prediction, the -5/3 law emerges in the presence of a \emph{saturation} in the ε-dependence of the scaling dimension of the eddy diffusivity at ε=3/2 when, according to perturbative renormalization, the velocity field becomes infra-red relevant.},

This means that the drift field can be decomposed into a symplectic and a gradient-like component with respect to a pseudo-metric tensor associated to random fluctuations affecting increments of only a sub-set of the degrees of freedom. Systems in this class are often encountered in applications as elementary models of Hamiltonian dynamics in an heat bath eventually relaxing to a Boltzmann steady state. Entropy production control in Langevin-Kramers models differs from the now well-understood case of Langevin-Smoluchowski dynamics for two reasons. First, the definition of entropy production stemming from fluctuation theorems specifies a cost functional which does not act coercively on all degrees of freedom of control protocols. Second, the presence of a symplectic structure imposes a non-local constraint on the class of admissible controls. Using Pontryagin control theory and restricting the attention to additive noise, we show that smooth protocols attaining extremal values of the entropy production appear generically in continuous parametric families as a consequence of a trade-off between smoothness of the admissible protocols and non-coercivity of the cost functional. Uniqueness is, however, always recovered in the over-damped limit as extremal equations reduce at leading order to the Monge-Ampère-Kantorovich optimal mass transport equations.},

We derive the equations governing the optimal control steering \emph{in finite time} the system between two equilibrium states. The corresponding thermodynamic transition is optimal in the sense that occurs at minimum entropy if the set of admissible controls is restricted by certain bounds on the time derivatives of the protocols. We apply our equations to the engineered equilibration of an optical trap considered in a recent proof of principle experiment. We also analyze an elementary model of nucleation previously considered by Landauer to discuss the thermodynamic cost of one bit of information erasure. We expect our model to be a useful benchmark for experiment design as it exhibits the same integrability properties of well known models of optimal mass transport by a compressible velocity field.},

We show how to compute large-scale indicators such as the inertial-particle terminal velocity and eddy diffusivity from first principles in a perturbative expansion around the limit of added-mass factor close to unity. Physically, this limit corresponds to the case where the mass density of the particles is constant and close in value to the mass density of the fluid which is also constant. Our approach differs from the usual over-damped expansion inasmuch we do not assume a separation of time scales between thermalization and small-scale convection effects. For general incompressible flows, we derive closed-form cell equations for the auxiliary quantities determining the terminal velocity and effective diffusivity. In the special case of parallel flows these equations admit explicit analytic solution. We use parallel flows to show that our approach enables to shed light onto the behavior of terminal velocity and effective diffusivity for Stokes numbers of the order of unity.},

As theoretical model we consider a periodically driven qubit coupled with a large yet finite electron reservoir, the calorimeter. The calorimeter is initially at equilibrium with an infinite phonon bath. As time elapses, the temperature of the calorimeter varies in consequence of energy exchanges with the qubit and the phonon bath. We show how under weak coupling assumptions, the evolution of the qubit-calorimeter system can be described by a generalized quantum jump process including as dynamical variable the temperature of the calorimeter. We study the jump process by numeric and analytic methods. Asymptotically with the duration of the drive, the qubit-calorimeter attains a steady state. In this same limit, we use multiscale perturbation theory to derive a Fokker--Planck equation governing the calorimeter temperature distribution. We inquire the properties of the temperature probability distribution close and at the steady state. In particular, we predict the behavior of measurable statistical indicators versus the qubit-calorimeter coupling constant.},

When the master equation is of the Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan form, its solution can be ``unraveled in quantum trajectories'' i.e. represented as an average over the realizations of a Markov process in the Hilbert space of the system. Quantum trajectories of this type are both an element of quantum measurement theory as well as a numerical tool for systems in large Hilbert spaces. We prove that general time-local and trace-preserving master equations also admit an unraveling in terms of a Markov process in the Hilbert space of the system. The crucial ingredient is to weigh averages by a probability pseudo-measure which we call the ``influence martingale". The influence martingale satisfies a 1-d stochastic differential equation enslaved to the ones governing the quantum trajectories. We thus extend the existing theory without increasing the computational complexity.},

The ideas outlined by Schrödinger also inspired the development of probabilistic interpretations of quantum mechanics by Fényes, Nelson and others as well as the notion of "Euclidean Quantum Mechanics" as probabilistic analogue of quantization. In the second part of the paper Schrödinger discusses the relation between time reversal and statistical laws of physics.

We show that the "influence martingale", the paramount ingredient of a recently discovered unraveling framework, pairs any time-local master equation with a one parameter family of Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan master equations. At any instant of time, the variance of the influence martingale provides an upper bound on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between solutions of paired master equations. Finding the lowest upper bound on the variance of the influence martingale yields an explicit criterion of "optimal pairing". The criterion independently retrieves the measure of isotropic noise necessary for the structural physical approximation of the flow the time-local master equation with a completely positive flow. The optimal pairing also allows us to invoke a general result on linear maps on operators (the "commutant representation") to embed the flow of a general master equation in the off-diagonal corner of a completely positive map which in turn solves a time-local master equation that we explicitly determine. We use the embedding to reverse a completely positive evolution, a quantum channel, to its initial condition thereby providing a protocol to preserve quantum memory against decoherence. We thus arrive at a model of continuous time error correction by a quantum channel.},

This result implies a lower bound on fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof Gaw\c{e}dzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition. Finally, we illustrate how F\"urth's relations admit a straightforward extension to piecewise deterministic processes.

The role of vortex stretching and enstrophy flux in the transfer of kinetic energy into potential energy at small scales is discussed.},

  abstract  = {The superdiffusion behavior, i.e., , with ν>1/2, in general is not completely characterized by a unique exponent. We study some systems exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion, i.e., 〈|x(t)|q〉∼tqν(q) where ν(2)>1/2 and qν(q) is not a linear function of q. This feature is different from the weak superdiffusion regime, i.e., ν(q)=const>1/2, as in random shear flows. The strong anomalous diffusion can be generated by nontrivial chaotic dynamics, e.g. Lagrangian motion in 2d time-dependent incompressible velocity fields, 2d symplectic maps and 1d intermittent maps. Typically the function qν(q) is piecewise linear. This corresponds to two mechanisms: a weak anomalous diffusion for the typical events and a ballistic transport for the rare excursions. In order to have strong anomalous diffusion one needs a violation of the hypothesis of the central limit theorem, this happens only in a very narrow region of the control parameters space. In the presence of strong anomalous diffusion one does not have a unique exponent and therefore one has the failure of the usual scaling of the probability distribution, i.e., P(x,t)=t−νF(x/tν). This implies that the effective equation at large scale and long time for P(x,t), can obey neither the usual Fick equation nor other linear equations involving temporal and/or spatial fractional derivatives.},

First, we study the concentration of particles continuously emitted from a point source with a given exit velocity distribution. The anisotropy of the latter turns out to be a necessary factor for the presence of a correction (with respect to the corresponding tracer case) at order square root of the Stokes number. Secondly, by means of a multiple-scale expansion, we analyse the particle effective diffusivity, and in particular its dependence on Brownian diffusivity, gravity effects and particle-to-fluid density ratio. In both cases, we obtain forced advection–diffusion equations for auxiliary quantities in the physical space, thus simplifying the problem from the full phase space to a system which can easily be solved numerically.},

  abstract      = {Quantum Error Mitigation (EM) is a collection of strategies to reduce errors on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices on which proper quantum error correction is not feasible. One of such strategies aimed at mitigating noise effects of a known environment is to realise the inverse map of the noise using a set of completely positive maps weighted by a quasi-probability distribution, i.e. a probability distribution with positive and negative values. This quasi-probability distribution is realised using classical post-processing after final measurements of the desired observables have been made. Here we make a connection with quasi-probability EM and recent results from quantum trajectory theory for open quantum systems. We show that the inverse of noise maps can be realised by performing classical post-processing on the quantum trajectories generated by an additional reservoir with a quasi-probability measure called the influence martingale. We demonstrate our result on a model relevant for current NISQ devices. Finally, we show the quantum trajectories required for error correction can themselves be simulated by coupling an ancillary qubit to the system. In this way, we can avoid the introduction of the engineered reservoir.},

Unraveling in quantum trajectories offers a picture of open system dynamics dual to solving master equations. In the unraveling picture, physical indicators are computed as Monte-Carlo averages over a stochastic process valued in the Hilbert space of the system. This approach is particularly adapted to simulate systems in large Hilbert spaces. %Drawing from our recent [Nat Commun 13, 4140 (2022)]. We show that the dynamics of an open quantum system generically admits an unraveling in the Hilbert space of the system described by a Markov process generated by ordinary stochastic differential equations for which rigorous concentration estimates are available. The unraveling can be equivalently formulated in terms of norm-preserving state vectors or in terms of linear \textquotedblleft ostensible\textquotedblright\ processes trace preserving only on average. We illustrate the results in the case of a two level system in a simple boson environment. Next, we derive the state-of-the-art form of the Di\'osi-Gisin-Strunz Gaussian random ostensible state equation in the context of a model problem. This equation provides an exact unraveling of open systems in Gaussian environments. We compare and contrast the two unravelings and their potential for applications to quantum error mitigation.},

The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics, to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics, leading to practical and conceptual difficulties. In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at minimum dissipation for stochastic underdamped dynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we prove that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation. Our results allow us to numerically study cost asymmetries in expansion and compression processes and make predictions for inertial corrections to optimal protocols in the Landauer erasure problem at the nanoscale.},

Essentially they control how fast the system thermalizes, equilibrates, {decoheres, and/or dissipates}. Moreover, very often they are directly accessible to be measured in the laboratory and hence they define key physical properties of the system. Experimentally measured relaxation rates can be used to test validity of a particular theoretical model. Here we analyze a fundamental question: {\em does quantum mechanics provide any nontrivial constraint for relaxation rates?} We prove the conjecture formulated a few years ago that any quantum channel implies that a maximal rate is bounded from above by the sum of all the relaxation rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. It should be stressed that this constraint is universal (it is valid for all quantum systems with finite number of energy levels) and it is tight (cannot be improved). In addition, the constraint plays an analogous role to the seminal Bell inequalities and the well known Leggett-Garg inequalities (sometimes called temporal Bell inequalities). Violations of Bell inequalities rule out local hidden variable models, and violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities rule out macrorealism. Similarly, violations of the bound rule out completely positive-divisible evolution.},

Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of [1], provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. We show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory except at the boundary and the evolution of the variance is non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.},

Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited.

A scenario that is commonly encountered in the experimental practice arises when the bosonic mode interacts with an external dissipative thermal bath, making the qubit-boson system open. In this work, we present a new analytical solution of the Lindblad master equations for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model and a perturbative analytical solution of the open quantum Rabi model in the limit of weak qubit-boson coupling $g$, using the holomorphic formalism in Bargmann space. Specifically, we derive the most general solution of the local Lindblad master equation for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model coupled to a thermal bath, with the only assumptions that the initial state of the qubit-boson system is separable. Additionally, we obtain a perturbative analytical solution for the open quantum Rabi model up to second order in $g$. Notably, our findings include a new formula for the qubit's steady state at zeroth order, showing that the stationary populations depend on both qubit and boson frequencies in the quantum Rabi model, but not in the Jaynes-Cummings model, regardless of the value of $g$.

  abstract         = {Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes, as they determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and dissipates. While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses, relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: 2-positivity is necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker -- yet still non-trivial -- universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.},

  abstract         = {We prove an upper bound on the trace of any 2-positive, trace-preserving map in terms of its smallest eigenvalue. We show that this spectral bound is tight, and that 2-positivity is necessary for this inequality to hold in general. Moreover, we use this to infer a similar bound for generators of one-parameter semigroups of 2-positive trace-preserving maps. With this approach we generalize known results for completely positive trace-preserving dynamics while providing a significantly simpler proof that is entirely algebraic.},

  abstract         = {We propose a model describing the formation of both dual (quantum) and classical Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions. According to this model, the dual Shapiro steps are formed at relatively low frequency of the microwave signal and low microwave power, while the classical steps are formed in the opposite limit of high frequency and power. The crossover between the two regimes is controlled by a single parameter - the effective relaxation time of the environment. The model accounts for the effect of a large inductor in the bias circuit, which has been used in recent experiments to protect the junction from the high frequency noise of the environment. We predict the possibility of observing both types of steps in the same sample. Our model describes the I-V curves observed in the experiments with reasonable accuracy, thus opening up an opportunity for quantitative fitting of the data.},

  abstract         = {We propose a reformulation of the problem of optimally controlled transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. We impose that any terminal cost specified by a thermodynamic functional should depend only on state variables and not on control protocols, according to the canonical Bolza form. In this way, we can unambiguously discriminate between transitions at minimum dissipation between genuine equilibrium states, and transitions at minimum work driving a system from a genuine equilibrium to a non-equilibrium state. For underdamped dynamics subject to a mechanical force, genuine equilibrium means a Maxwell-Boltzmann probability distribution defining a vanishing current velocity. Transitions at minimum dissipation between equilibria are a model of optimal swift engineered equilibration. Remarkably, we show that transitions at minimum work do not directly imply explicit boundary conditions on terminal values of parameters of the mechanical force and on control protocols. Thus, the problem often discussed in the literature, that optimal protocols need terminal jumps to satisfy boundary conditions, completely disappears. The quantitative properties of optimal controls are entirely determined by the form of the penalty modelling an experimental setup. More generally, we use centre manifold theory to analytically account for the tendency of optimal controls to exhibit a turnpike property: optimal protocols in the bulk of the control horizon tend to converge to a universal centre manifold determined only by the running cost. Exponential deviations from the centre manifold occur at the ends of the control horizon in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. Our findings are supported numerically.},
